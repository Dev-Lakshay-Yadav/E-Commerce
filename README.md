This MERN Stack E-commerce Website is a fully functional online shopping platform built using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It features a secure payment gateway (PayPal integration), role-based authentication, and a dynamic admin dashboard for managing products, orders, and users. Users can add products to their cart or wishlist, place orders, and leave reviews and ratings for products. The platform ensures a smooth shopping experience with real-time order management and a responsive UI. This project highlights my expertise in full-stack development, showcasing my ability to build scalable, secure, and user-friendly web applications.
